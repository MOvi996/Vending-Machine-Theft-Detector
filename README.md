# Vending-Machine-Theft-Detector
The idea is to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on large number of videos of humans interacting with the required object, enabling automatic detection of potential theft incidences. For this, we used vgg19 architecture and collected training dataset of 10 videos (a total of 2052 images) from 3 different camera angles and featuring 6 different subjects.
