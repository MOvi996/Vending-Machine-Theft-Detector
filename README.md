# Vending-Machine-Theft-Detector
The idea is to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on large number of videos of humans interacting with the required object, enabling automatic detection of potential theft and robberies. For this, we used vgg19 architecture and collected training dataset of 10 videos (a total of 2052 images) from 3 different camera angles and featuring 6 different subjects.

While we have implemented the idea for vending machine theft detection (a major issue in college hostels), the solution can be applied to solve much serious problems like ATM theft detection or house robberies.
